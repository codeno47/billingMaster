# Overview

This is an Employee Billing Management System built as a full-stack web application. The system allows administrators and finance managers to manage employee records, track billing information, and generate reports. It features role-based access control with two user types: administrators (full access) and finance managers (read-only access to most features). The application provides CRUD operations for employee data, CSV import/export functionality, and comprehensive billing analytics.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)
- Fixed database connection issues with Neon PostgreSQL by optimizing websocket configuration
- Resolved CSV export routing conflict by moving export route before /:id parameter route
- Updated CSV export format to match provided template with proper formatting:
  - SLNO, Name, Rate ($X.XX), Role, Cost-Centre, Team, C-ID, Start-Date, End-Date, Status (Active/Inactive), Band, SOW-ID, Appx Billing ($X,XXX.XX), Shift, Comments
- Enhanced export functionality with proper number formatting and error handling
- Fixed change reports to show newly added employees by setting changesSummary during employee creation
- Enhanced delete functionality to track employee deletions in change reports instead of permanent removal
- Modified employee queries to exclude deleted employees from regular listings while preserving deletion history

- Created comprehensive use case testing document (USE_CASES.md) covering all application functionality, user roles, and edge cases
- Implemented 30-minute session timeout with activity monitoring and user warning system
- Added automatic session expiry with 2-minute warning dialog before logout
- Enhanced security with rolling session expiry that resets on user activity
- Added "Reset Filters" button to Employee module for clearing all applied filters at once
- Enhanced filter UI with active filter count indicator and improved organization
- Fixed export functionality to respect applied filters and export only visible filtered records instead of entire dataset
- Enhanced employee form validation to enforce required fields (Name, Cost Centre, Start Date, Shift, Status, Team)
- Added visual indicators for mandatory fields with asterisks and improved error messaging
- Implemented comprehensive date validation for DD-MM-YYYY format with invalid date rejection
- Added cross-field validation to ensure start date is before end date
- Added character limit validation for comments field (256 characters max) with real-time character count
- Implemented calendar date picker components for Start Date and End Date fields to improve user experience
- Created reusable DatePicker component with DD-MM-YYYY format support and popover calendar interface
- Enhanced CSV import validation to prevent importing empty files with appropriate error messages
- Added validation for CSV files with no data records and improved user feedback
- Enhanced Billing Management with comprehensive filtering and pagination capabilities
- Added sortable columns, search functionality, and rate range filters to billing page
- Implemented responsive pagination with page navigation and records per page options
- Added comprehensive pagination to Reports module with filtering, sorting, and page navigation
- Implemented real-time cache invalidation for Reports module to ensure immediate updates when employee data changes
- Fixed synchronization issue between Employee and Reports modules - status changes now reflect immediately without manual refresh
- Enhanced all employee mutations (create, update, delete, import, clear) to invalidate reports cache for seamless data consistency
